	<history>
	Roof Rage development started end of 2015, back then I was working on various prototypes for a fighting game, the main idea was to have a game with a great scale and variety. Once I found the gameplay and style I was looking for, I focused on graphics and animations.
It quickly became a passion for pixelart and animation as I was creating sprites, levels, effects etc. 
I eventually became a father along the way and somehow managed to finish the game.
Pentadrangle joined me (I begged) and created awesome 16bits tracks for the game.
